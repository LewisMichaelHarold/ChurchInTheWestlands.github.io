A new website for the two churches in Newcastle-under-Lyme, free of charge, by me.
This is the original church website: http://www.churchinthewestlands.org.uk/
This is the one created by me so far: https://lewismichaelharold.github.io/

To do:
1. Make a favicon.
2. Delay the box glow until after the animation.
3. Add St. Peter's church.
4. Make an interactive calendar to view upcoming services and events.
5. Make contact pages.
